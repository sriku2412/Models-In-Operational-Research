## Overview

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for me for the Operations Research course during the winter term at Schulich. The course provides a survey of selected topics in operational research (OR), with a strong emphasis on practical application rather than theoretical aspects. Topics covered include financial planning, production optimization, priority planning, marketing strategies, and more. 

## Objectives

- Introduce quantitative reasoning and comparative analysis for defensible decision-making.
- Develop proficiency in mathematical modeling and computational tools for operations research.
- Enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills through the analysis of diverse business scenarios.
- Provide insight into the mathematical structure and applicability limits of operations research tools.

This repository will house course materials, case studies, software demonstrations, and additional resources to support anyone in understanding and applying operations research concepts effectively.

### Topics Covered:
- Linear programming
- Mixed-integer linear programming
- Nonlinear optimization
- Stochastic programming
- Online convex optimization

## Course Learning Outcomes

Operations research is crucial for decision-making across various sectors, utilizing scientific techniques to optimize outcomes based on available data. This course aims to expose students to the field of operations research, demonstrating its significance in improving organizational productivity and facilitating informed decision-making in complex managerial settings. By the course's conclusion :

- Gain exposure to quantitative reasoning and comparative analysis for defensible decision-making in business environments.
